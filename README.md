This website was created using HTML and CSS.
It showcases a tribute about the person I admire most, the one that has given me more inspiration in this field of work.
It is a single page with images and text to describe this person.

**HOW TO RUN IT**
1. First clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/JohnAlex1900/WebsiteTribute.git
2. cd into the directory:
  cd WebsiteTribute
3. Open any code editor of your choice and run a local server so as the webpage is displayed:
  for instance on Visual Studio Code:
    a) Install Live Server extension on the extensions tab on VSCode.
    b) At the bottom of VSCode, click on "Go Live", so as to start the server, then Voila, the website is displayed.

If you have any questions or issues. Perform a pull request and I will address the issue.
